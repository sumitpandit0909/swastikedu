        <h3>4. Another bad news on the crude oil front, the price of petrol and diesel is set to increase!</h3>
        <img src="./post-images/post-8.12.png" alt="">
        <p>New Delhi: Amidst the rise in the price of crude oil at the international level, its production in the country has reduced. If we look at the data, there was a decline in the production of crude oil in India in December 2021 as well. The country's crude oil production has declined by about two percent due to reduced production of state-owned ONGC.</p>
        <h5>Why the fear of increasing the price?</h5>
        <p>Due to less domestic supply than demand, India has to meet 85 percent of its crude oil requirement through imports. The current situation is that the prices of crude oil have increased globally. On the other hand, domestic production is decreasing.
