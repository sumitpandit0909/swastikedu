          <h3>1. Conflict over Ukraine in UN: America's allegation – peace in danger because of Russia; Counterattack of Russian Diplomat - spreading false fear</h3>
          <img src="./post-images/post-34.png" alt="">
          <p>Tensions between Russia and America regarding Ukraine are not taking the name of reduction. Diplomats of both the countries clashed during the voting on Ukraine issue in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday. On behalf of the US, it is alleged that Russia is endangering the peace of the region by gathering troops on the Ukraine border. At the same time, the Russian Diplomat retaliated, accusing America of spreading false fear.
<br><br>
            Amidst all these accusations, US President Joe Biden also warned Russia in a threatening tone in the United Nations Security Council. Biden said- If Russia is ready to address our security concerns through dialogue, then only America and its allies will move forward in this direction. Instead, Russia will face dire consequences if it attacks Ukraine.
            <br><br>
            <b>India distances itself from voting</b><br><br>
            India took the middle path by not participating in this voting. India has very good relations with both Russia and America, if it took the side of either, it would have a negative effect on mutual relations. India chose to stay away from this matter in view of its own interest.
            <br><br>
            US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield at the UNSC meeting said – The situation we are facing in Europe is dangerous. Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's borders shows an aggressive pattern. If the Russians attacked Ukraine, none of us would be able to say we didn't know about it in advance. At the same time, Russian Diplomat Vasily Nebenzia called America a country inciting conflict. He said that America wants war. While Russia had no plans to attack Ukraine.<br><br>
            Nebenzia said – Russia wants peace in the region, but America and its allies are trying to weaken Russia on the country. They are creating unnecessary tension between Russia and Ukraine. The Security Council meeting was adjourned after two hours without any action. After Nebenzia left, the US diplomat said that the Russians did not give us the answers we expected.
            <br><br>
           <b> Diplomats of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Berlin</b><br><br>
            Let us tell you that there has been a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine after an 8-hour meeting in Paris last week. These two countries are going to meet again in Berlin soon. Tensions between the two countries have continued since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014. Last year, Putin had deployed 1.50 lakh soldiers on the Ukraine border, after which the crisis of war increased.

        <h3>2. China's brutality on Arunachal's youth: tying hands and feet, giving electric shocks, kicking and punching; Father said - my son is mentally broken</h3>
        <img src="./post-images/post-34.1.png" alt="">
        <p>अरुणाचल प्रदेश के युवक मिराम तारोन को कुछ वक्त पहले चीनी सेना ने बॉर्डर से अगवा कर लिया था। जिसके बाद उसे भारत को सौंपने से पहले 8 दिन तक टॉर्चर किया गया। इस बात का खुलासा खुद मिराम के पिता ने किया है। एक अंग्रेजी अखबार की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, मिराम के पिता ओपंग तारोन ने बताया कि मेरा बेटा मानसिक रूप से इतना टूट चुका है कि वह किसी से बात नहीं कर पा रहा है। <br><br>

            ओपंग तारोन ने कहा- मेरे बेटे को चीन की पीपुल्स लिबरेशन आर्मी (PLA) हाथ-पैर और आंखों पर पट्टी बांधकर 209 घंटे तक प्रताड़ित करती रही। उसे बिजली के झटके दिए। हैवानों की तरह पीठ पर लात-घूंसे जड़े। मिरान ने मुझे बताया कि उसे नो मैन्स लैंड (भारत और चीन सीमा की ऐसी जगह जहां कोई नहीं होता) से पकड़ लिया गया था। इसके बाद उसे आंखों पर पट्टी बांधकर एक शिविर में ले जाया गया।</p><br>
            <b>PLA tortured till the last minute</b><br><br>
            <img src="./post-images/post-34.2.png" alt=""><br>
            <p>
            Miram estimates that the place must have been about a kilometer away from No Man's Land. He said that Miram was tortured till a few minutes before he was handed over to our army in Anjou district of Arunachal on January 27. He was kept blindfolded till then. According to Opang, Miram's hands, feet and blindfold were removed only when it was time to eat or go to the toilet.<br><br>
            <b>Chinese used to beat them with kicks thrice a day</b></p>
            <img src="./post-images/post-34.3.png" alt=""><br>
            <p>
            Opang told that he was kicked in the back three times in the initial times. Small things like lighters were used to deliver an electric shock. He was also tortured while eating. Every time his plate was filled with meat. After returning to India, Miram was taken in a vehicle to Kibithu, where he was quarantined for three days.<br><br>

<b>what is the whole matter</b><br><br>
Miram, a resident of Jindo village, and his friend were abducted by the Chinese army on January 18. Miram's friend somehow escaped from the Chinese clutches and informed the Indian Army. The hand of China was being told behind the kidnapping. But China had vehemently denied the allegations against it. However, on January 20, the Chinese army had acknowledged the presence of the unidentified minor and also confirmed that he was Indian.

        <h3>3. Disasters are not stopping in Brazil: Floods and landslides wreak havoc after heavy rains in Sao Paulo, 19 people killed, many missing</h3>
        <img src="./post-images/post-34.4.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Floods and landslides caused by heavy rains have wreaked havoc in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo. At least 19 people died, including 7 children. This information has been given on Sunday by the officials looking after the work related to the security of the citizens. So Paulo officials say nine people have been injured, while four are missing.
<br><br>
Apart from this, about 500 families have had to leave their homes. Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria on Sunday took stock of the flooded areas and said he had approved 15 million reais ($2.79 million) in emergency aid for the affected cities.



        </p>
        <img src="./post-images/post-34.5.png" alt="">
        <p>A statement from the federal government's Ministry of Regional Development said it was monitoring the situation. The most affected areas around So Paulo include Aruja, Francisco Morato, Embu das Artes and Franco da Rocha.</p>
        <h3>4. US MP showed his position to PAK, said - don't make jihadi ambassador</h3>
        <h5>US lawmaker Scott Perry has objected to the name of Masood Khan as the next ambassador to Pakistan, saying that Khan has praised Hizbul Mujahideen and other terrorist organizations. He has encouraged the youth to become jihadis.</h5>
        <img src="./post-images/post-34.6.png" alt="">
        <p>Washington: Pakistan has once again faced international humiliation. US Congressman Scott Perry has objected to the appointment of Masood Khan as the next ambassador of Pakistan and appealed to President Joe Biden to dismiss him. In his letter to Biden, the MP has described Masood Khan as a 'jihadi'. It is worth noting that recently, Pakistan had announced the appointment of Hizbul supporter Masood Khan as its new ambassador in America. Since then there has been a ruckus.
<br><br>
            <b>MP wrote this in the letter</b><br><br>
            In his letter to President Joe Biden, US lawmaker Scott Perry said, 'I am excited to learn that the State Department has reportedly stopped the approval of Masood Khan as the new ambassador to Pakistan. But just stopping is not enough. I urge you to reject any diplomatic certificate presented to you by Masood Khan.<br><br><br>
           <b> Referring to Indian allies</b><br><br>
           
            Perry has appealed to the President to reject any attempt by the Government of Pakistan to make this jihadi Pakistan's ambassador to the US. He further said that the Imran Khan government has nominated a true terrorist sympathizer working to undermine our interests in the region, as well as the security of our Indian allies. This decision of Pakistan is related to Islamabad's constant contempt for America.<br><br>
            <b>Statements were given against the US</b><br><br>
            MP Perry wrote that Masood Khan has praised Hizbul Mujahideen and other foreign terrorist organizations. Khan encouraged the youth to be like jihadis like Burhan Wani, a former Hizbul Mujahideen commander who fought against India for the rest of his life. He further wrote in his letter that Masood Khan had made statements against the US in 2017 for banning Hizbul Mujahideen.
            <br><br>
           <b> Who is Masood Khan?</b><br><br>
            Masood Khan is a hardline bureaucrat of Pakistan. He has described many terrorists killed in Kashmir as messiahs. At present, his appointment has been banned by the US State Department. After the letter of MP Scott Perry, the possibilities have increased that the US will give a blow to Pakistan by rejecting his appointment. By the way, the letter of the American MP is no less than an embarrassment for Imran Khan and his country Pakistan.</p>

            <h5>Russia and America face off in the United Nations Security Council over Ukraine.

                <img src="./post-images/post-34.9.png" alt="">
                <p>London: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson's difficulties on the 'Partygate' matter do not seem to be reducing at the moment. However, after the release of the report of the investigation conducted on Partygate, he has made a demand, but has rejected the demand of the opposition to resign.

But in Downing Street, the official residence of the Prime Minister of Britain, Boris was seen having a liquor party in violation of the lockdown. After the news came in the media, the demand for his resignation started rising. After this, the investigation of the matter was started under the leadership of public servant Sue Grey.

Failures of leadership and judgment allowed things to happen that "shouldn't have been allowed to happen." PM Boris Johnson apologized as soon as the report was released.
                    <br><br>
                   <b> Resignation demand rejected</b><br>
                    He told lawmakers in the House of Commons that he and his government could be trusted. He will change the way the government is run in the wake of the "Partygate" issue. I hope that I will fix it. At the same time, Johnson rejected the demands of opposition leaders and some of his Conservative MPs to resign.</p>

The Taliban has held former US Navy officer Mark Frerichs hostage for the past two years. Now US President Joe Biden has expressed displeasure over this and asked the Taliban to release Frerich.

                            <b>'Holding cruelty and cowardice'</b><br>
                            US President Joe Biden said that two years ago US Navy veteran Mark Frerich was taken hostage in Afghanistan. He said, Frerich spent a decade helping the people of Afghanistan as a civil engineer. He hasn't done anything wrong. Still, the Taliban has kept him captive for two years. The President said in a stern tone that taking Americans or any innocent civilian hostage is a sign of cruelty and cowardice.

                            Biden said the Taliban should immediately release Mark before he could expect any consideration of his aspirations for legitimacy. There can be no negotiation on this subject. At the same time, the family of former officer Mark Frerich has appreciated this statement of the President. At the same time, he also said that he wants the release of Frerichs as soon as possible.

                            <b>Taliban's economic pulse suppressed</b><br>
                            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on 15 August last year. Since then the country is facing all kinds of problems including economic. Many countries, including America, have suppressed the economic pulse of the Taliban, due to which it has become difficult for them to run the country. The Taliban wants the world to recognize it, but so far this has not happened. Let us tell you that for the last 20 years, the civilian government of Afghanistan was given huge amounts of money from many countries including America. After the capture of the Taliban, the US government has frozen all the funds of the Afghan government deposited in its country's banks.</p>
