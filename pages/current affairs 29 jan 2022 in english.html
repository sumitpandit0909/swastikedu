          <img src="./post-images/post-30.5.png" alt="">
          <p>New Delhi: Countries all over the world are getting entangled in the ongoing tension of Russia with Ukraine.

              <h3>2. The truth of the new corona virus! Will NeoCov kill every third patient?</h3>
              <h5>From the city of Wuhan where the corona virus first spread all over the world, the scientists of the same Wuhan have given such information to the world, which has given people sleepless nights. Scientists said that one out of every three deaths will occur due to the new type of corona virus.</h5>
              <img src="./post-images/post-30.6.png" alt="">
              <p>New Delhi: Scientists from Wuhan in China have given information about a new type of corona virus Neokov. It seems that the world is getting sleepless nights due to this. Speculation about its seriousness is haunting many.
                  <br><br>
                  According to the report of our partner website WION, some questions are being raised about this new corona virus. What is the truth behind this, let us know...<br><br>
                  <b>Is this a different type of corona virus?</b><br><br>
                  It is a new strain or another type of corona virus such as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. This is not a new variant like the Omicron or the Delta. The study, conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wuhan University, suggests that NeoCoV is closely related to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a viral disease. It was first recognized in Saudi Arabia in 2012.<br><br>
                  <b>How worried should we be?</b><br><br>
                  It is believed to be highly transparent and have a high mortality rate. According to scientists in Wuhan, one in three patients infected with NeoCoV could die due to complications.</p>

                      <br><br>

                      <b>Fears of attack on Ukraine</b><br><br>
                      US President Joe Biden warned Ukraine's president a day earlier that there was a clear possibility that Russia could take military action against his country in February. Foreign Minister Lavrov said in an interview with a Russian radio station, 'As long as it is up to the Russian Federation, there will be no war, we do not want war. But we will not allow our interests to be trampled upon and neglected.
                      
                      Russia has mobilized more than a million soldiers near the Ukrainian border, raising fears of war in the region. Russia has consistently denied that it is planning an attack on Ukraine, but the US and its NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) allies believe that Russia is heading towards war and is preparing for it. .</p>

                              Tokyo: Six Japanese youths have sued the company that operates the Fukushima nuclear plant. He alleges that he developed thyroid cancer after being exposed to radiation during a meltdown at the plant in 2011. The victims' lawyers marched to the Tokyo District Court, where dozens of supporters gathered.
                              <br><br>
<b>Company sued for the first time regarding health issue</b><br><br>
The plant is operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). This is the first time that someone has filed a lawsuit against the company over health issues. The ages of the generations are between 7 and 27 years. He was living in the Fukushima area when a major earthquake triggered a tsunami on March 11, 2011, leading to a nuclear disaster. <br><br>

<b>seeking $5.4 million in compensation</b><br><br>
His lawyers said he had surgery to remove all of his thyroid glands that had been affected by radiation. The victims are demanding 616 million yen (about Rs 40 crore 60 lakh) as compensation. However, last year a UN expert panel concluded that the disaster did not directly cause any health problems for the people living in the area.
