          <p>New Delhi: Uttar Pradesh elections are very near. The dates have been announced. Although the assembly elections are in 5 states, all eyes are on the UP elections. Well, this is not the first time. The politics of UP has always been the focus of the eyes of the whole country. This state has given many big leaders to the country.

But there was a time when Mulayam Singh Yadav became MLA without contesting elections. The story behind it is very interesting.
            <br><br>
            In fact, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was studying in college, he was so engrossed in student politics that his colleagues and friends started calling him MLA. At that time he studied in KK College, Etawah. From here he did his graduation and came into student politics after being influenced by the ideology of the Socialist Party. He contested the student union elections and won. During this, he did not do name politics but also did a lot of work. He used to work to solve all the problems of the students. His contact was also good, so his friends used to get the work done inside the college as well as outside in his name. That's when friends started calling Mulayam Singh Yadav as MLA.</p>

                    <h5>IAS deputation Rule Change: There have been protests against the new rule for the appointment of IAS officers.

                    <p>New Delhi: The opposition to the IAS Cadre Rules Change proposed by the Central Government is increasing. The governments of many states of the country are continuously opposing it. After West Bengal, now Kerala and Tamil Nadu have objected to these rules.

In this letter, MK Stalin wrote that the IAS cadre rules proposed by the Center are a direct attack on the policies of the federal structure and the autonomy of the states.
                        <br><br>
                        MK Stalin also wrote in his letter, 'State governments work at their respective levels in the implementation of various programs including the schemes of the central government. States often have to face natural calamities, in which case the services of more IAS officers are needed than elsewhere. That's why they keep demanding other officers as well. That is, it is clear that due to the shortage of officers, the work of the states will be affected. Lateral entry recruitment of the central government has also affected the morale of the officers who are willing to deputation.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>This state is also against</b><br><br>
                        Earlier, the governments of West Bengal, Rajasthan, Jharkhand along with Chhattisgarh (Chattisgarh) have objected to these rules. Talking about the letter of the CM of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, through his letter, has appealed to the central government to withdraw the changes in the rules. He said that this move of the government would create fear psychosis among the administrative officers and they would find it difficult to implement the policies of the state government.</p>
