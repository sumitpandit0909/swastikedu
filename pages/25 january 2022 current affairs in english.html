                            According to the news of 'The Sun', this idea of ​​earning crores from junk came to the mind of a person named Suzannah Harvey. Then he bought this retired plane for a penny. In the year 2020, the person had paid only one pound i.e. 100 rupees for this. Then spent about Rs 5 crore to convert it into a luxurious bar. But now this junk plane has become a means of earning crores.

But party enthusiasts are ready to pay this amount very comfortably and Harvey is earning huge money from this.</p>
