          <img src="./post-images/post-12.1.png" alt="">
          <p>New Delhi: The Amar Jawan Jyoti, which has been burning at the India Gate in the capital Delhi for the last 50 years, has been merged with the Amar Jawan Jyoti located at the National War Memorial. Politics has started only after this decision of the government. Opposition leaders claimed that this was an insult to the soldiers who laid down their lives fighting for the country. Today we are going to tell you about the history of Amar Jawan Jyoti. <br>
            <br>
           <b> What was Amar Jawan Jyoti?</b><br>
            The Amar Jawan Jyoti below the India Gate in central Delhi was an iconic symbol of the nation's tribute to the soldiers who died for the country in various wars and conflicts since independence. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, 3,843 soldiers of the country were martyred. It was built in the memory of those martyrs in 1972. It was inaugurated on Republic Day 1972 by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, after India defeated Pakistan in December 1971.
            
           <br><br>
            
           <b>Jyoti is running continuously for 50 years</b><br>
            Key elements of the Amar Jawan Jyoti included a black marble plinth, a cenotaph, which served as the tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The plinth contained an inverted L1A1 self-loading rifle with a bayonet, over which was a soldier's battle helmet. There were four urns on the establishment, in which there were four burners. On normal days one of the four burners was lit, but on important days like Republic Day, all four burners were lit. These burners were called the eternal flame, and were never allowed to be extinguished.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>  Amar Jyoti used to burn like this</b><br>
            The Amar Jyoti had been burning under the India Gate for over 50 years, but it was extinguished on Friday as it was merged with another Amar Jyoti at the National War Memorial. They were kept alive with the help of cylinders of petroleum gas or LPG. One cylinder can keep a burner alive for one and a half days.
            <br>
            It was changed in 2006. Although in a project that cost around Rs 6 lakh, the fuel for the flames was changed from LPG to Piped Natural Gas, or PNG. Jwala, which paid tribute to Indian soldiers through this piped gas, was kept alive forever.
            <br>
            <b>  Why was it built at India Gate?</b> <br>
            India Gate, earlier known as the Indian War Memorial, was built by the British in 1931. It was built as a memorial to around 90,000 Indian soldiers of the British Indian Army, who had died in many wars and campaigns till then. The names of more than 13,000 martyred soldiers have been mentioned on the memorial. Since it was a memorial to Indian soldiers killed in wars, Amar Jawan Jyoti was established by the government in 1972 under it.

In the Greek-Roman period, a law was made that if any person went to this temple, then his head would be beheaded.</p>
